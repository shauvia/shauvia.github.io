# CSS

CSS allows to create rules to control the way individual box and its content is presented.

Example styles:
Box
- width and height
- Borders (color, width, style)
- position in the browser window

Text:
Typeface, Size, Color, Italics, bold, uppercase, lowercase, small-caps

CSS rule: 
-selector and declaration

```
p {
  font-family: Arial;
}
```

Several properties specified: 

```
h1, h2, h3 {
  font-family: arial;
  color: yellow;
}
```

### External CSS

`<link href='style.css' type='text/css' rel='stylesheet'/>`

### Color

The color poperty allows to specify the coloer of thext inside any element. 
Three ways to do that: 
-RGB values
-HEX code
-Color names


### Background color

CSS treats each HTML element as it appears in the box. The background-color property sets the color of the background for that box.
