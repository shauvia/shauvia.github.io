# My Learning Journal - Growth Mindset and Markdown

## What is a Mindset?
Mindset is they way people think abount themselves. A kind of self-theory that people hold about themselves. 

## Type of Mindsets

Fixed Minset | Growth Mindset
------------ | -------------
People believe that that their basic qualities like talent are fixed. People are "labeled": talented, smart intelligent. It is believing that talent along can create a success, without effort. | People believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point

### Three things to remember about the Growth Mindset:
* No one is a master at the beginning
* Learning a new thing, strategies is hard at the beginning for every one. 
* I don't know **YET!**

## Markdown Langauge

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax.

### What is is used for?

Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor

### The hey goal for the language:

Its key design goal is readability – that the language be readable as-is.

## Examples

Code example | How it looks like
------------ | -------------
`# This is an <h1> tag`| # This is an `<h1>` tag
`__This text will be bold__`| __This text will be bold__
Numbered list:  `1 Item 1`| 1 Item 1

# A Git Tutorial

##3 Version Control

Version Control is a system that allows to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes.

Version Control (VCS) allows: 
+ file or project can be reverted to previous cersion
+ track modifications and modifying individuals
+ to ompare changes

### Local Version Control

Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.

### Centralized Version Control
Created because of the need for collaboration within a developer team on a single file or set of files. Single server stores all changes and file versions kind of data backups.

### Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)
Help to avoid the one big disadvatage: the server as a single point of failure. To avoid data lost DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories

## GIT
it is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Every commit - changed version - 



#### To check the file Staus use:
```
$ git status
```
#### Tracking a file: 
```
git add filename
```

#### Tracking files:
```
$ git add *
```

#### Making a Commit:

After staging one or multiple files, the changes should be commited and recorded what you did within the commit message:
```
$ git commit -m “made change x,y,z”
```
